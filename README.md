# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project  

This project is for a band called Cape Town Panic. The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. Following interviews with the client’s representatives:
Their primary target audiences were their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
The band provided me with the following assets that they wanted to showcase on their website; Photos of the band members, a video clip and audio clips.

They were in the process of creating a social media presence so i added dummy links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. The dummy url's can be changed as of when they have created their various social media pages.

## UX

This website is focused on the bands fans who would like to see updates on the band and see their music back catalog and also new catalog as of when it's released.
Also their potential clients who would like them to perform at their events and parties.

My project helps the bands fans looking for updates on the bands music catalog, recent pictures and videos by creating a media tab on the main menu, as this is a main focus i've made this one of the first things you see when you launch the website.
When the fan goes onto the media page they will see three of the bands main songs (this can be updated to add and delete songs as of when the band wish), recent pictures and also a video of a recent performance the band has done.

My project also helps the bands possible clients by providing a availability description on the home page, this describes what the band does in clear bulletpoints with descriptive and persuasive text that will draw in the eye of the potential client.
I've included a "About Us" page that shows the user who the band members are and a clear description of who they are. I've also included a "Contact Us" page that is aimed to create easy communication between potential clients and the band to arrange performances,
this is also easily viewable as its on the main menu.
 
Following this section I include a list of User Stories to bulletpoint angles covered.
- As a potential fan, I want to listen to the bands music libraries to see if I like the band or not, I look at the media tab of the main menu bar and see the library which i can listen to.
- As a fan, I want to look at recent pictures of the band, I look at the media tab of the main menu bar and see recent pictures of the band I can look at.
- As a potential client, I want to see the availability of the band in regards to performing at my wedding, I look on the home page and see the band is available to perform at weddings and also some persuasive text that reassures me that I'm choosing the right band to perform at my wedding.
- As a potential client, I want to contact the band so i can get them to perform at my wedding, I look at the contact us section on the main menu and see an easy to follow contact us form.
- As a fan and potential client, I want to see the bands social media pages, I look at the footer located at any of the pages on the website and see easily locateable social media glyph-icons that follow through to any social media page i wish.

- Social media dummy links to be changed as of when the band creates their social media pages.
- Media page to be updated as of when the band wish.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
    - The project uses **CSS** to stylise the project.
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - The project uses **HTML5** to format and build the project.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to stylise the project.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
